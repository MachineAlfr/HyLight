Arduino code for transmitter/receiver HyLight-Arduino interface boards:

Any form of serial communication can be used to send data to the a transmitter. The recommended method is PySerial. If PySerial is not installed, install using: $ sudo pip install pyserial. The baud must be set to 9600 and the data to be transmitted must be in the form of a string with 11 digits, e.g. "1 100 500 300 350 0 250 80 600 250 0". The string must also be encoded into byte data. This string tells the transmitter to send 10 PWM values to a specific HyLighter, in this case HyLighter Receiver #02 will set LED 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8, and 9 to a duty cycle of 100, 500, 300, 350, 250, 80, 600, and 250, respectively. LEDs 5 and 10 are not turned on, i.e. the duty cycle is set to 0. The first digit indicates the HyLight number, so a value of 0 corresponds to HyLight Receiver #1, a value of 1 to HyLight Receiver #2, and so on. The next ten digits indicates the duty cycle of the 10 HyLight LEDs, with 4096 being the absolute max. The HyLight will never reach the max power of one LED, and will continuously turn off if the duty cycle is set to max. Always stay below 15% of any LEDs max duty cycle to avoid damaging the HyLighter LED boards.
